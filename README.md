# 1 What is cparser?
It is a library for writing arbitrary parsers, as long as their language is of
the same type that of the C language (so called TODO languages).

It features a complete C99 parser. Additionally, it offers basic regular
expressions.

# 2 Why using cparser?

  * cparser has no library dependencies (except the default C/C++ libraries)
  * cparser is a very fast parser (TODO: benchmarks)
  * cparser is minimal: a very small parser
  * cparser is modifiable: you can write one grammar, and then specify
    multiple visitors.

# 3 Documentation
Type `make doc` for doxygen. TODO: more stuff here...
